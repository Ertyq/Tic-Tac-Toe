This is a school project.

All the files were created by me from scratch.

I started work on this project version on April 14 2025 and published it on April 18 2025.
I took me nearly 26 working hours to complete this project.

The Algoritm I created isn't perfect, it lacks some major adjustements and optimalization. However, for me it works just fine and I'm pretty satisfied with the result.
In defense of such an incomplete algorithm, I can say that it was my first encounter with such complex algorithms and that it is my first program written in JavaScript. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
